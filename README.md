Writing data to thingspeak from raspberry Pi Pico W

# Raspberry Pi Pico W ThingSpeak Data Logger

This repository contains a tutorial on how to use Raspberry Pi Pico W (Raspberry Pi Pico with WiFi) to send data to ThingSpeak, a cloud service owned by MathWorks, the same vendor that develops MATLAB software. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to utilize the built-in temperature sensor on the Raspberry Pi Pico W for sending data to ThingSpeak. However, you can easily adapt the provided code to work with any type of sensor.
